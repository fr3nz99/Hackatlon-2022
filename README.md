**Heart rate zones**, or HR zones, are a way to monitor how hard you’re training. 
There are typically 5+1 heart rate zones (Zone-0, Zone-1,…,Zone-5) based on the intensity of training with regard to the individual maximum heart rate.

Heart rate zones are closely linked to your aerobic and anaerobic thresholds. Understanding this can really help when considering heart rate zones exercise, especially your heart rate zones for running or heart rate zone training for other fitness goals.


### Data Collection

Modern sports watches contain many sensors to monitor heart rate, cadence, altitude, etc. The readings are typically saved every once per second.

The data are coming from FIT files collected on many runs during 2021 and 2022. The runs were made in various environments, i.e. hilly and flat. Also, various efforts, e.g. long and slow runs and interval training, are included. The data collection was made using an Apple Watch accompanied by a Polar OH1 sensor.

### Classification Task

We are provided with data relative to 1 minute long running efforts in order to predict the associated heart-rate zone.
